  export const ABOUT_ME = [
    {
        aboutmetext: "Hi! I`m at the thrilling beginning of my career transition from the travel sector to the technology and software development. Having spent over a year gaining practical experience, I`ve effectively bridged my robust customer service background from IT in Poland and the travel industry in Iceland into my tech career. I am very communicative, enjoying the exchange of ideas and thriving when contributing to a team's success. My creative approach to problem-solving allows me to generate innovative solutions, while my proficiency in conflict resolution ensures a harmonious and productive work environment. Currently, I'm enhancing my technical skills through a contract with a Polish company, focusing on WordPress and PHP. I am also eagerly adopting and implementing new technologies as they arise. My fascination with technology extends into my personal life as well, where I`ve constructed a home IT infrastructure. This setup includes several servers and mini computers like Raspberry Pi, enabling me to delve into homelabing and hardware. I experiment with data containerization, virtualization, everyday helping technologies and apps as well as just having fun. Beyond technology, I am passionate about skiing, rock and ice climbing, as well as hiking which allow me to explore the breathtaking landscapes of Iceland. Birdwatching is another interest I cherish, especially as it's an activity I share with my children. Volunteering for environmental cleanup initiatives in Iceland (Hreinni Hornstrandir) or just cleaning beaches myself also reflects my commitment to community and sustainable practices. As I continue to blend my rich past experiences with my current technological pursuits, I am eager to bring my unique perspective and skills to innovative projects and collaborative teams."
